The issue occurred on the Field Force General page, which includes a filter section where users can add multiple rows of criteria, specifying column names, operators, and values for a search. After setting the filter criteria, users can click the search button to fetch records with pagination and use the export button to export records without pagination based on the filter criteria. The problem arose when users added two or more rows in the filter criteria and left the value field empty for the second or subsequent rows. This led to an error in forming the payload for the export API. The root cause was traced back to a merge conflict during the transition from version R8.1 to R9.1 of the codebase. This conflict was not handled properly, resulting in the incorrect formation of the export payload when certain filter criteria were used, specifically when some rows lacked specified values.
