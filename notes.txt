Hi @Indranil Goswami,

This defect is fixed and deployed in the environment with the Pull request [https://github.com/manulife-ca/fasat-cdtccr-fasat-ui/pull/7304](https://github.com/manulife-ca/fasat-cdtccr-fasat-ui/pull/7304).

Bug type: UI Coding issue

Detailed analysis: On our page, we have three grids: Rate Key Grid (master grid), Rate Detail Grid, and Rate Participant Grid. Upon selecting data from the Rate Key Grid, the other two grids get populated accordingly. Initially, when selecting a participant for Row 1 from the Rate Key Grid, the participant grid was updated correctly. However, when selecting Row 2 from the Rate Key Grid and adding a participant, the participant grid should reflect the new participant for Row 2. Due to a coding issue, the grid was incorrectly fetching data for Row 1 instead of Row 2. This issue has now been resolved.

This version includes the context about the three grids and explains the defect and its resolution more clearly.
