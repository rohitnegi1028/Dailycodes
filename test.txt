Agenda: Session Expiry Timeout Implementation

Discussion:
Today’s meeting focused on the recent implementation of session expiry timeout within our web application. The primary concern addressed was the potential conflict arising from the intersection of session expiry timeout and the display of an ideal timeout pop-up notification.

During the discussion, it was clarified that the session expiry timeout was previously not implemented but has now been integrated into the system. However, the default timeout period coincides with the ideal timeout notification, causing user experience issues.

To mitigate this conflict, the decision was made to extend the session expiry timeout to 180 minutes. It was emphasized that any adjustment beyond the initial 120-minute mark requires valid business justification.

Action Items:

	1.	Technical Adjustment:
	•	Update session expiry timeout to 180 minutes to align with the current implementation.
	•	Ensure compatibility with the ideal timeout pop-up notification.
	2.	Business Justification:
	•	Coordinate with the business team to provide a valid justification for extending the session expiry timeout.
	3.	Deployment Schedule:
	•	Immediate deployment of changes to the Lower QE environment.
	•	Scheduled deployment to UDT environment by 11:00 PM EST on April 18, 2024.

Next Steps:

	•	Technical team to adjust the session expiry timeout as per the decision.
	•	Business team to provide necessary justification for the timeout extension.
	•	Continuous monitoring of application behavior post-deployment to ensure optimal performance.

Conclusion:
The meeting concluded with a clear plan of action to address the session expiry timeout conflict. All stakeholders are in agreement regarding the proposed changes and deployment schedule. Further updates will be communicated as progress is made.
